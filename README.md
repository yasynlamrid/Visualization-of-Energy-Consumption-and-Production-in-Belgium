# Energy Consumption and Production Visualization Project in Belgium
This project was made using Python and Flask and deployed on Docker. The main goal is to fetch energy data from Belgium through the Elia API and visualize it to analyze electricity production, consumption, and energy exchanges with neighboring countries.

# Project Features:
## Electricity Consumption:
Shows the total electricity consumption in Belgium in real-time.

## Electricity Production:
Visualizes the electricity production in Belgium, broken down by different energy sources:

Coal-based energy

Landfill gas (biogas from buried waste)

Natural gas

Nuclear

Other energy sources

Energy from waste recovery

Wind energy

## Energy Exchanges with Neighboring Countries:
Shows the exports and imports of energy between Belgium and neighboring countries:

France

Luxembourg

United Kingdom

Netherlands

Germany

## Project Goal:
The main goal is to compare energy production with consumption in Belgium and identify when Belgium exports or imports energy. This helps to better understand energy flows and electricity needs at different times.

## Technologies Used:
Python: Programming language for data retrieval and processing.
Flask: Web framework for building backend services.
Docker: Application deployment in containers for easier management of development and production environments.
Elia API: Source of energy consumption and production data in Belgium.
